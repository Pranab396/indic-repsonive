            <p>With India’s rich history and culture, it’s hardly a surprise that the temples here are among its most
                valuable assets. The combined heritage of religion, culture and tradition has given the country a
                plethora of architectural marvels, temples that are more than 1,000 years old. Once upon a time, these
                ancient temples in India were used as sites where dance, music and combative practises were honed. Today
                they remind us of our past and are examples of the architectural brilliance of craftsmen from ancient
                times. Here are some of the most beautiful ancient temples in India that uphold the country’s rich
                cultural heritage.</p>

            <img src="/img/konarkSunTemple.jpg" alt="Pic of Konark Sun Temple">
            <p>Built in the 13th century by the kings of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, the Konark Sun Temple is
                situated in
                the small town of Konark in Puri, Orissa. This marvel of architecture is dedicated to the sun god,
                and
                the gigantic structure is meant to resemble the sun god’s chariot, with 12 pairs of elaborately
                carved
                stone wheels, dragged by seven horses. Today, the temple stands without the vimana, or the main
                sanctum,
                which once stood 229 feet tall. A wonderful example of Kalinga architecture, this ancient temple of
                India is made with Khondalite rocks and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

            <img src="/img/mahabalipuram.jpg" alt="Pic of Mahabalipuram Temple">
            <p>Part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Mahabalipuram group of temples are a reflection of the rich
                cultural heritage of the seventh and eighth century of India. These ancient structures are located in
                the coastal resort town of Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, India, and were built by the Pallava kings in the
                7th and 8th centuries. The temple town Mahabalipuram has approximately 40 monuments and Hindu temples,
                which are a mix of ratha-(chariot)shaped temples, mandapas (cave) temples, huge open-air rock reliefs,
                and the Shore temple, all dedicated to Shiva.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <img src="/img/kailashTemple.jpg" alt="Pic of Kailasha Temple">
            <p>Located in cave 16 of the Ellora Caves in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, the Kailasa temple was built by King
                Krishna I in AD 760 to represent Mt Kailasa, Shiva’s Himalayan abode. This astonishing temple is known
                as one of India’s greatest monuments due to its massive size, amazing architecture, and mind-boggling
                detailed carvings. It was carved in perfect proportion from a single piece of basalt rock from
                Charanandri Hills by hand, using chisels, hammers and picks. It also might be the reason why it’s
                considered as an engineering marvel-a perfect spot for history and architecture lovers.</p>
